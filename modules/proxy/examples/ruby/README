This directory contains the compiled thrift Accumulo proxy API and an example client for ruby.

To run this script, type the following:
ruby -I . test_client.rb <host of server>

(the -I option is needed for ruby 1.9.x)

Warning: the script as it is will attempt to connect to your accumulo instance, create a table, and add some rows to it.
