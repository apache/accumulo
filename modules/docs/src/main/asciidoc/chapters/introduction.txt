== Introduction
Apache Accumulo is a highly scalable structured store based on Google's BigTable.
Accumulo is written in Java and operates over the Hadoop Distributed File System
(HDFS), which is part of the popular Apache Hadoop project. Accumulo supports
efficient storage and retrieval of structured data, including queries for ranges, and
provides support for using Accumulo tables as input and output for MapReduce
jobs.

Accumulo features automatic load-balancing and partitioning, data compression
and fine-grained security labels.
