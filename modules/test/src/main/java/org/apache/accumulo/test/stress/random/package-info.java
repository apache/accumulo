/**
 * This package contains utility classes designed to test Accumulo when large cells are being written. This is an attempt to observe the behavior Accumulo
 * displays when compacting and reading these cells.
 *
 * There are two components to this package: {@link org.apache.accumulo.test.stress.random.Write} and {@link org.apache.accumulo.test.stress.random.Scan}.
 *
 * The {@link org.apache.accumulo.test.stress.random.Write} provides facilities for writing random sized cells. Users can configure minimum and maximum
 * sized portions of a cell. The portions users can configure are the row, column family, column qualifier and value. Note that the sizes are uniformly
 * distributed between the minimum and maximum values. See {@link org.apache.accumulo.test.stress.random.WriteOptions} for available options and default sizing
 * information.
 *
 * The Scan provides users with the ability to query tables generated by the Write. It will pick a tablet at random and scan the entire range. The
 * amount of times this process is done is user configurable. By default, it happens 1,024 times. Users can also specify whether or not the scan should be
 * isolated or not.
 *
 * There is no shared state intended by either of these services. This allows multiple clients to be run in parallel, either on the same host or distributed
 * across hosts.
