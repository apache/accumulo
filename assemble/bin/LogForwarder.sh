#   port [required] - port that XMLSocketReceiver is listening on.
#   filter [optional] - filter for log file names, * and ? are valid wildcards
#   start [optional] - filter log messages beginning at this time (format is yyyyMMddHHmmss)
#   end [optional] - filter log messages ending at this time (default is now, format is yyyyMMddHHmmss)
