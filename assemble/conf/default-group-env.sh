# This script is called from accumulo-service and serves as a mechanism to set
# ACCUMULO_JAVA_OPTS and provide property overrides for the server processes in
# a resource group. This allows the user to set a base configuration in
# accumulo-env.sh and accumulo.properties and then tailor the configuration of
# the individual processes in a resource group. For example, when you have a
# cluster comprised of sets of servers with different amounts of memory, then
# the user can set default JVM heap settings in accumulo-env.sh, and then
# increase or decrease in this file.
#
# This script will export ACCUMULO_JAVA_OPTS and PROPERTY_OVERRIDES variables
# based on the service type for the default resource group.  Additional files can
# be created based on the groups configured in cluster.yaml and should be named
# "{groupName}-group-env.sh". The contents of ACCUMULO_JAVA_OPTS will be appended
# to the JAVA_OPTS variable that is created in accumulo-env.sh, allowing the user
# to override any setting for this resource group. Likewise, the contents of
# PROPERTY_OVERRIDES will be appended to the arguments provided to the server
# class allowing the user to override any Accumulo property for this resource group.
# Overriding the bind address and group name properties would not be advisable as
# this could lead to deployment issues.

#  Examples:
#
#    Override JVM args
#    export ACCUMULO_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m"
#
#    Override Accumulo properties
#    export PROPERTY_OVERRIDES=('-o' 'rpc.backlog=1000' '-o' 'tserver.hold.time.max=10m')
