[Apache Accumulo][accumulo] is a sorted, distributed key/value store that provides robust,
scalable data storage and retrieval. With Apache Accumulo, users can store and manage large
data sets across a cluster. Accumulo uses [Apache Hadoop]'s HDFS to store its data and
[Apache Zookeeper] for consensus. Check out the [Accumulo project website][accumulo] for
news and general information.

## Getting Started

* Follow [these instructions][install] to install and run Accumulo
* Read the [Accumulo documentation][docs]
* Run the [Accumulo examples][examples] to learn how to write Accumulo clients
* View the [Javadocs][javadocs] to learn the Accumulo API

More resources can be found on the [project website][accumulo].

## Building

Accumulo uses [Maven] to compile, [test], and package its source. The following
command will build the binary tar.gz from source. Add `-DskipTests` to build without
waiting for the tests to run.

    mvn package

This command produces `assemble/target/accumulo-<version>-bin.tar.gz`

## Accumulo API

The public Accumulo API is composed of all public types in the following packages
and their subpackages excluding those named *impl*, *thrift*, or *crypto*.

   * org.apache.accumulo.core.client
   * org.apache.accumulo.core.data
   * org.apache.accumulo.core.security
   * org.apache.accumulo.minicluster

A type is a class, interface, or enum.  Anything with public or protected
acccess in an API type is in the API.  This includes, but is not limited to:
methods, members classes, interfaces, and enums.  Package-private types in
the above packages are *not* considered public API.

The following regex matches imports that are *not* Accumulo public API. This
regex can be used with [RegexpSingleline][regex] to automatically find
suspicious imports in a project using Accumulo.

```
import\s+org\.apache\.accumulo\.(.*\.(impl|thrift|crypto)\..*|(?!core|minicluster).*|core\.(?!client|data|security).*)
```

The Accumulo project maintains binary compatibility across this API within a
major release, as defined in the Java Language Specification 3rd ed. Starting
with Accumulo 1.6.2 and 1.7.0 all API changes will follow [semver 2.0][semver]

## Export Control

This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you
currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or
re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any
encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and
policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption
software, to see if this is permitted. See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more
information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security
(BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN)
5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using or performing
cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of this
Apache Software Foundation distribution makes it eligible for export under the
License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the
BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object code and
source code.

The following provides more details on the included cryptographic software:

Apache Accumulo uses the built-in java cryptography libraries in its RFile
encryption implementation. See [oracle's export-regulations doc][java-export]
for more details for on Java's cryptography features. Apache Accumulo also uses
the bouncycastle library for some crypographic technology as well. See
[the BouncyCastle FAQ][bouncy-faq] for
more details on bouncycastle's cryptography features.
