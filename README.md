Apache Accumulo
===============

The [Apache Accumuloâ„¢][1] sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage and retrieval system.  Apache Accumulo
is based on Google's [BigTable][4] design and is built on top of Apache
[Hadoop][5], [Zookeeper][6], and [Thrift][7]. Apache Accumulo features a few
novel improvements on the BigTable design in the form of cell-based access
control and a server-side programming mechanism that can modify key/value pairs
at various points in the data management process. Other notable improvements
and feature are outlined [here][8].

To install and run an Accumulo binary distribution, follow the [install][2]
instructions.
  
Documentation
-------------

Accumulo provides the following documentation :

 * **User Manual** : In-depth developer and administrator documentation.
 * **Examples** : Code with corresponding readme files that give step by step
                  instructions for running example code.

This documentation is available on the [Accumulo site][1].  In the source and
binary distributions of Accumulo, the documentation is at different locations.

In the Accumulo binary distribution, all documentation is in the `docs`
directory.  The binary distribution does not include example source code, but
it does include a jar with the compiled examples.   This examples jar makes it
easy to step through the example readmes, after following the [install][2]
instructions.

In the Accumulo source, documentations is found at the following locations.

 * [Example Source](examples/simple/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/examples/simple)
 * [Example Readmes](docs/src/main/resources/examples)
 * [User Manual Source](docs/src/main/asciidoc)

Building 
--------

Accumulo uses [Maven][9] to compile, [test][3], and package its source.  The
following command will build the binary tar.gz from source.  Note, these
instructions will not work for the Accumulo binary distribution as it does not
include source.

    mvn package -P assemble

This command produces a file at the following location.

    assemble/target/accumulo-X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz

This will not include documentation, adding the `-P docs` option to the maven
command will build documentation.

API
---

The public Accumulo API is composed of :

All public types in the following packages and their subpackages excluding
those named *impl*, *thrift*, or *crypto*. 

   * org.apache.accumulo.core.client
   * org.apache.accumulo.core.data
   * org.apache.accumulo.core.security
   * org.apache.accumulo.minicluster

A type is a class, interface, or enum.  Anything with public or protected
acccess in an API type is in the API.  This includes, but is not limited to:
methods, members classes, interfaces, and enums.  Package-private types in
the above packages are *not* considered public API.

The following regex matches imports that are *not* Accumulo public API.  This
regex can be used with [RegexpSingleline][13] to automatically find suspicious
imports in a project using Accumulo. 

```
import\s+org\.apache\.accumulo\.(.*\.(impl|thrift|crypto)\..*|(?!core|minicluster).*|core\.(?!client|data|security).*)
```

The Accumulo project maintains binary compatibility across this API within a
major release, as defined in the Java Language Specification 3rd ed. Starting
with Accumulo 1.6.2 and 1.7.0 all API changes will follow [semver 2.0][12]
