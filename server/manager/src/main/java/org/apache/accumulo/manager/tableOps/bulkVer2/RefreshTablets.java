 * This Repo asks hosted tablets that were bulk loaded into to refresh their metadata. It works by

 * ask the tablets at those locations to refresh their metadata. It the tablets are no longer the
 * location its ok. That means the tablet either unloaded before of after the snapshot. In either
 * case the tablet will see the bulk files the next time its hosted somewhere.
