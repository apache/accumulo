 * The type of configured Thrift server to start. This is meant more as a developer knob to ensure
 * that appropriate Thrift servers can be constructed to make a better test on the overhead of SSL
 * or SASL.
 *
 * Both SSL and SASL don't presently work with TFramedTransport which means that the Thrift servers
 * with asynchronous support will fail with these transports. As such, we want to ensure that any
 * benchmarks against "unsecure" Accumulo use the same type of Thrift server.
