<h1>Apache Accumulo Documentation : Timestamps</h1>

<p>Everything inserted into accumulo has a timestamp.  If the user does not
set it, then the system will set the timestamp.  The timestamp is the last
thing accumulo sorts on.  So when two keys have the same row, column family,
column qualifier, and column visibility then the timestamp of the two keys is
compared. 

<p>Timestamps are sorted in descending order, so the most recent data comes
first.  When a table is created in accumulo, by default it has a versioning
iterator that only shows the most recent.  In the example below two identical
things are inserted.  The scan after that only shows the most recent version.
However when the versioning iterator configuration is changed, then both are
seen.  When data is inserted with a lower timestamp than existing data, it will
fall behind the existing data and may not be seen depending on the versioning
settings.  This is why the insert made with a timestamp of 500 is not seen in
the scan below.

<p>Deletes are special keys in accumulo that get sorted along will all the other
data.  When a delete key is inserted, accumulo will not show anything that has
a timestamp less than or equal to the delete key.  In the example below an
insert is made with timestamp 5 and then a delete is inserted with timestamp 3.
The scan after that show that the delete marker does not hide the key.  However
when a delete is inserted with timestamp 5, then nothing can be seen.  Once a
delete marker is inserted, it is there until a full major compaction occurs.
That is why the insert made after the delete can not be seen.  The insert after
the flush and compact commands can be seen because the delete marker is gone.
The flush forced a minor compaction and compact forced a full major compaction.

<p>If two inserts are made into accumulo with the same row, column, and
timestamp, then the behavior is non-deterministic.

<p>Accumulo 1.2 introduces the concept of logical time.  This ensures that
timestamps set by accumulo always move forward.  There have been many problems
caused by tablet servers with different system times.  In the case where a
tablet servers time is in the future, tablets hosted on that tablet server and
then migrated will have future timestamps in their data.  This can cause newer
keys to fall behind existing keys, which can result in seeing older data or not
seeing data if a new key falls behind on old delete.  Logical time prevents
this by ensuring that accumulo set time stamps never go backwards, on a per
tablet basis.  So if a tablet servers time is a year in the future, then any
tablet hosted there will generate timestamps a year in the future even when
later hosted on a server with correct time. Logical time can be configured on a
per table basis to either set time in millis or to use a per tablet counter.
The per tablet counter gives unique one up time stamps on a per mutation
basis. When using time in millis, if two things arrive within the same
millisecond then both receive the same timestamp. 

<p>The example below shows a table created using a per tablet counter for
timestamps.  Two inserts are made, the first gets timestamp 0 the second 1.
After that the table is split into two tablets and two more inserts are made.
These inserts get the same timestamp because they are made on different
tablets.    When the original tablet is split into two, the two child tablets
inherit the next timestamp of their parent and start from there. So do not
expect this configuration to offer unique timestamps across a table.  Its only
purpose is to uniquely order events within a tablet.
