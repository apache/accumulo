/**
 * An {@link AuthenticationToken} that wraps a "Hadoop style" delegation token created by Accumulo.
 * The intended scope of this token is when a KerberosToken cannot be used instead. The most common
 * reason for this is within YARN jobs. The Kerberos credentials of the user are not passed over the
 * wire to the job itself. The delegation token serves as a mechanism to obtain a transient shared
 * secret with Accumulo using a {@link KerberosToken} and then run some task authenticating with
 * that shared secret.
 *
 * <p>
 * Obtain a delegation token by calling
 * {@link SecurityOperations#getDelegationToken(org.apache.accumulo.core.client.admin.DelegationTokenConfig)}
 *
 * @since 1.7.0
