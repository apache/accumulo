   * <p>
   * <b>WARNING</b>. Using this method with custom iterators may have unexpected results. Iterators
   * have control over which column families are fetched. However iterators have no control over
   * which column qualifiers are fetched. When this method is called it activates a system iterator
   * that only allows the requested family/qualifier pairs through. This low level filtering
   * prevents custom iterators from requesting additional column families when calling seek.
   *
   * <p>
   * For an example, assume fetchColumns(A, Q1) and fetchColumns(B,Q1) is called on a scanner and a
   * custom iterator is configured. The families (A,B) will be passed to the seek method of the
   * custom iterator. If the custom iterator seeks its source iterator using the families (A,B,C),
   * it will never see any data from C because the system iterator filtering A:Q1 and B:Q1 will
   * prevent the C family from getting through. ACCUMULO-3905 also has an example of the type of
   * problem this method can cause.
   *
   * <p>
   * tl;dr If using a custom iterator with a seek method that adds column families, then may want to
   * avoid using this method.
