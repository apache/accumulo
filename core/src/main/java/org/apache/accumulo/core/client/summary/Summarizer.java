/**
 * Instances of this interface can be configured for Accumulo tables. When Accumulo compacts files,
 * it will use this Factory to create {@link Collector} and {@link Combiner} objects to generate
 * summary information about the data in the file.
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to merge summary information from multiple files, Accumulo will use this factory to
 * create a {@link Combiner} object.
 *
 * <p>
 * Below is an example of a very simple summarizer that will compute the number of deletes, total
 * number of keys, min timestamp and max timestamp.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *   public class BasicSummarizer implements Summarizer {
 *
 *     public static final String DELETES_STAT = &quot;deletes&quot;;
 *     public static final String MIN_STAMP_STAT = &quot;minStamp&quot;;
 *     public static final String MAX_STAMP_STAT = &quot;maxStamp&quot;;
 *     public static final String TOTAL_STAT = &quot;total&quot;;
 *
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public Collector collector(SummarizerConfiguration sc) {
 *       return new Collector() {
 *
 *         private long minStamp = Long.MAX_VALUE;
 *         private long maxStamp = Long.MIN_VALUE;
 *         private long deletes = 0;
 *         private long total = 0;
 *
 *         &#064;Override
 *         public void accept(Key k, Value v) {
 *           if (k.getTimestamp() &lt; minStamp) {
 *             minStamp = k.getTimestamp();
 *           }
 *
 *           if (k.getTimestamp() &gt; maxStamp) {
 *             maxStamp = k.getTimestamp();
 *           }
 *
 *           if (k.isDeleted()) {
 *             deletes++;
 *           }
 *
 *           total++;
 *         }
 *
 *         &#064;Override
 *         public void summarize(StatisticConsumer sc) {
 *           sc.accept(MIN_STAMP_STAT, minStamp);
 *           sc.accept(MAX_STAMP_STAT, maxStamp);
 *           sc.accept(DELETES_STAT, deletes);
 *           sc.accept(TOTAL_STAT, total);
 *         }
 *       };
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public Combiner combiner(SummarizerConfiguration sc) {
 *       return (stats1, stats2) -&gt; {
 *         stats1.merge(DELETES_STAT, stats2.get(DELETES_STAT), Long::sum);
 *         stats1.merge(TOTAL_STAT, stats2.get(TOTAL_STAT), Long::sum);
 *         stats1.merge(MIN_STAMP_STAT, stats2.get(MIN_STAMP_STAT), Long::min);
 *         stats1.merge(MAX_STAMP_STAT, stats2.get(MAX_STAMP_STAT), Long::max);
 *       };
 *     }
 *   }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Below is an example summarizer that counts the log of the value length.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * public class ValueLogLengthSummarizer implements Summarizer {
 *
 *  &#64;Override
 *  public Collector collector(SummarizerConfiguration sc) {
 *
 *    return new Collector(){
 *
 *      long[] counts = new long[32];

 *        int idx;
 *        if(v.getSize() == 0)
 *          idx = 0;
 *        else
 *          idx = IntMath.log2(v.getSize(), RoundingMode.UP);  //IntMath is from Guava
 *
 *        counts[idx]++;
 *      }
 *
 *      &#64;Override
 *      public void summarize(StatisticConsumer sc) {
 *        for (int i = 0; i &lt; counts.length; i++) {
 *          if(counts[i] &gt; 0) {
 *            sc.accept(""+(1&lt;&lt;i), counts[i]);
 *          }
 *        }
 *      }
 *    };
 *  }
 *
 *  &#64;Override
 *  public Combiner combiner(SummarizerConfiguration sc) {
 *    return (m1, m2) -&gt; m2.forEach((k,v) -&gt; m1.merge(k, v, Long::sum));
 *  }
 * }

 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The reason a Summarizer is a factory for a Collector and Combiner is to make it very clear in the
 * API that Accumulo uses them independently at different times. Therefore its not advisable to
 * share internal state between the Collector and Combiner. The example implementation shows that
 * the Collectors design allows for very efficient collection of specialized summary information.
 * Creating {@link String} + {@link Long} pairs is deferred until the summarize method is called.
 *
 * <p>
 * Summary data can be used by Compaction Strategies to decide which files to compact.
 *
 * <p>
 * Summary data is persisted, so ideally the same summarizer class with the same options should
 * always produce the same results. If you need to change the behavior of a summarizer, then
 * consider doing this by adding a new option. If the same summarizer is configured twice with
 * different options, then Accumulo will store and merge each one separately. This can allow old and
 * new behavior to coexists simultaneously.
