/**
 * The ContextClassLoaderFactory provides a mechanism for various Accumulo components to use a
 * custom ClassLoader for specific contexts, such as loading table iterators. This factory is
 * initialized at startup and supplies ClassLoaders when provided a context.
 *
 * <p>
 * This factory can be configured using the <code>general.context.class.loader.factory</code>
 * property. All implementations of this factory must have a default (no-argument) public
 * constructor.
 *
 * <p>
 * A default implementation is provided for Accumulo 2.x to retain existing context class loader
 * behavior based on per-table configuration. However, after Accumulo 2.x, the default is expected
 * to change to a simpler implementation, and users will need to provide their own implementation to
 * support advanced context class loading features. Some implementations may be maintained by the
 * Accumulo developers in a separate package. Check the Accumulo website or contact the developers
 * for more details on the status of these implementations.
 *
 * <p>
 * Because this factory is expected to be instantiated early in the application startup process,
 * configuration is expected to be provided within the environment (such as in Java system
 * properties or process environment variables), and is implementation-specific.
 *
 * @since 2.1.0
