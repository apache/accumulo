/**
 * Defines the general behavior of a filter.
 * <p>
 * A filter is a data structure which aims at offering a lossy summary of a set <code>A</code>. The
 * key idea is to map entries of <code>A</code> (also called <i>keys</i>) into several positions in
 * a vector through the use of several hash functions.
 * <p>
 * Typically, a filter will be implemented as a Bloom filter (or a Bloom filter extension).
 * <p>
 * It must be extended in order to define the real behavior.
