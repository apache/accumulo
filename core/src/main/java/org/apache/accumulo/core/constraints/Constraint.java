/**
 * Constraint objects are used to determine if mutations will be applied to a table.

 * <p>
 * This interface expects implementers to return violation codes. The reason codes are returned
 * instead of arbitrary strings to encourage conciseness. Conciseness is needed because violations
 * are aggregated. If a user sends a batch of 10,000 mutations to Accumulo, only aggregated counts
 * about which violations occurred are returned. If the constraint implementer were allowed to
 * return arbitrary violation strings like the following:
 *
 * <p>
 * Value "abc" is not a number<br>
 * Value "vbg" is not a number
 *
 * <p>
 * This would not aggregate very well, because the same violation is represented with two different
 * strings.
