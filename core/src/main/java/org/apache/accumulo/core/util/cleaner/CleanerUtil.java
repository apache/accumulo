/**
 * This class collects all the cleaner actions executed in various parts of the code.

 * <p>
 * These actions replace the use of finalizers, which are deprecated in Java 9 and later, and should
 * be avoided. These actions are triggered by their respective objects when those objects become
 * phantom reachable.
 *
 * <p>
 * In the "unclosed*" methods below, the object should have been closed (implements AutoCloseable).
 * We could possibly consolidate these into a single method which only warns, and doesn't try to
 * clean up. We could also delete them entirely, since it is the caller's responsibility to close
 * AutoCloseable resources, not the object's own responsibility to detect that it wasn't closed.
