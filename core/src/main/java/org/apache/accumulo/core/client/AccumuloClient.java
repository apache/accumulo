/**
 * Client connection to an Accumulo instance. Allows the user to request a scanner, deleter or
 * writer for the instance as well as various objects that permit administrative operations.
 * Enforces security on the client side by requiring user credentials.
 *
 * <p>
 * Supports fluent API for creation. Various options can be provided to {@link Accumulo#newClient()}
 * and when finished a call to build() will return the AccumuloClient object. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (AccumuloClient client = Accumulo.newClient()
 *        .to(instanceName, zookeepers)
 *        .as(user, password).build())
 * {
 *   // use the client
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If migrating code from Connector to AccumuloClient an important difference to consider is that
 * AccumuloClient is closable and Connector is not. Connector uses static resources and therefore
 * creating them is cheap. AccumuloClient attempts to clean up resources on close, so constantly
 * creating them could perform worse than Connector. Therefore, it would be better to create an
 * AccumuloClient and pass it around.
 *
 * <p>
 * AccumuloClient objects are intended to be thread-safe, and can be used by multiple threads.
 * However, care should be taken to ensure that the client is eventually closed, to clean up any
 * resources in use in the client application when all threads are finished with the AccumuloClient
 * object. Additionally, while the client itself is thread-safe, it is not necessarily true that all
 * objects produced from the client (such as Scanners) are thread-safe.
 *
 * @since 2.0.0
 * @see <a href="https://accumulo.apache.org/docs/2.x/getting-started/clients">Accumulo Client
