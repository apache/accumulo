/**
 * This class automates management of static singletons that maintain state for Accumulo clients.
 * Historically, Accumulo client code that used Connector had no control over these singletons. The
 * new AccumuloClient API that replaces Connector is closeable. When all AccumuloClients are closed
 * then resources used by the singletons are released. This class coordinates releasing those
 * resources. For compatibility purposes this class will not release resources when the user has
 * created Connectors.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is intermediate solution to resource management. Ideally there would be no static
 * state and AccumuloClients would own all of their state and clean it up on close. If
 * AccumuloClient is not closable at inception, then it is harder to make it closable later. If
 * AccumuloClient is not closable, then its hard to remove the static state. This class enables
 * making AccumuloClient closable at inception so that static state can be removed later.
