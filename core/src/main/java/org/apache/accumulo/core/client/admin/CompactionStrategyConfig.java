/**
 * Configuration object which describes how a Compaction is run. Configuration objects are dependent
 * upon the CompactionStrategy running insider the server. This class is used in conjunction with
 * {@link CompactionConfig}.
 *
 * @since 1.7.0
 * @deprecated since 2.1.0 CompactionStrategies were deprecated for multiple reasons. First, they do
 *             not support the new compaction execution model. Second, they bind selection and
 *             output file configuration into a single entity when users need to configure these
 *             independently. Third, they use internal Accumulo types and ensuring their stability
 *             requires manual effort that may never happen. Fourth, writing a correct compaction
 *             strategy was exceedingly difficult as it required knowledge of internal tablet server
 *             synchronization in order to avoid causing scans to hang. Fifth although measure were
 *             taken to execute compaction strategies in the same manner as before, their execution
 *             in the new model has subtle differences that may result in suboptimal compactions.
 *             Please migrate to using {@link CompactionSelectorConfig} and
 *             {@link CompactionConfigurerConfig} as soon as possible.
