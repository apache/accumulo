/**
 * This interface facilitates atomic checks of tablet metadata prior to updating tablet metadata.
 * The way it is intended to be used is the following.
 * <ol>
 * <li>On the client side a TabletMetadataCheck object is created and passed to Ample</li>
 * <li>Ample uses Gson to serialize the object, so it must not reference anything that can not
 * serialize. Also it should not reference big things like server context or the Manager, it should
 * only reference a small amount of data needed for the check.
 * <li>On the tablet server side, as part of conditional mutation processing, this class is
 * recreated and the {@link #canUpdate(TabletMetadata)} method is called and if it returns true the
 * conditional mutation will go through.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations are expected to have a no arg constructor.
 * </p>
