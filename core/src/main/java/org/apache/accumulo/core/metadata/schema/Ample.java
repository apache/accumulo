/**
 * Accumulo Metadata Persistence Layer. Entry point and abstractions layer for reading and updating
 * persisted Accumulo metadata. This metadata may be stored in Zookeeper or in Accumulo system
 * tables.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface seeks to satisfy the following goals.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Provide a single entry point for all reading and writing of Accumulo Metadata.
 * <li>The root tablet persists its data in Zookeeper. Metadata tablets persist their data in root
 * tablet. All other tablets persist their data in the metadata table. This interface abstracts how
 * and where information for a tablet is actually persisted.
 * <li>Before the creation of this interface, many concurrent metadata table updates resulted in
 * separate synchronous RPCs. The design of this interface allows batching of metadata table updates
 * within a tablet server for cluster wide efficiencies. Batching is not required by
 * implementations, but the design of the interface makes it possible.
 * <li>Make code that updates Accumulo persistent metadata more concise. Before this interface
 * existed, there was a lot of redundant and verbose code for updating metadata.
 * <li>Reduce specialized code for the root tablet. Currently there is specialized code to manage
 * the root tablets files that is different from all other tablets. This interface is the beginning
 * of an effort to remove this specialized code. See #936
 * </ul>

     * <p>
     * Ample provides the following features on top of the conditional writer to help automate
     * handling of edges cases that arise when using the conditional writer.
     * <ul>
     * <li>Automatically resubmit conditional mutations with a status of
     * {@link org.apache.accumulo.core.client.ConditionalWriter.Status#UNKNOWN}.</li>
     * <li>When a mutation is rejected (status of
     * {@link org.apache.accumulo.core.client.ConditionalWriter.Status#REJECTED}) it will read the
     * tablets metadata and call the passed rejectionHandler to determine if the mutation should be
     * considered as accepted.</li>
     * <li>For status of
     * {@link org.apache.accumulo.core.client.ConditionalWriter.Status#INVISIBLE_VISIBILITY} and
     * {@link org.apache.accumulo.core.client.ConditionalWriter.Status#VIOLATED} ample will throw an
     * exception. This is done so that all code does not have to deal with these unexpected
     * statuses.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * The motivation behind the rejectionHandler is to help sort things out when conditional
     * mutations are submitted twice and the subsequent submission is rejected even though the first
     * submission was accepted. There are two causes for this. First when a threads is running in
     * something like FATE it may submit a mutation and the thread dies before it sees the response.
     * Later FATE will run the code again for a second time, submitting a second mutation. The
     * second cause is ample resubmitting on unknown as mentioned above. Below are a few examples
     * that go over how Ample will handle these different situations.
     *
     * <h4>Example 1</h4>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>Conditional mutation CM1 with a condition requiring an absent location that sets a future
     * location is submitted. When its submitted to ample a rejectionHandler is set that checks the
     * future location.</li>
     * <li>Inside Ample CM1 is submitted to a conditional writer and returns a status of UNKNOWN,
     * but it actually succeeded. This could be caused by the mutation succeeding and the tablet
     * server dying just before it reports back.</li>
     * <li>Ample sees the UNKNOWN status and resubmits CM1 for a second time. Because the future
     * location was set, the mutation is returned to ample with a status of rejected by the
     * conditional writer.</li>
     * <li>Because the mutation was rejected, ample reads the tablet metadata and calls the
     * rejectionHandler. The rejectionHandler sees the future location was set and reports that
     * everything is ok, therefore ample reports the status as ACCEPTED.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h4>Example 2</h4>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>Conditional mutation CM2 with a condition requiring an absent location that sets a future
     * location is submitted. When its submitted to ample a rejectionHandler is set that checks the
     * future location.</li>
     * <li>Inside Ample CM2 is submitted to a conditional writer and returns a status of UNKNOWN,
     * but it actually never made it to the tserver. This could be caused by the tablet server dying
     * just after a network connection was established to send the mutation.</li>
     * <li>Ample sees the UNKNOWN status and resubmits CM2 for a second time. There is no future
     * location set so the mutation is returned to ample with a status of accepted by the
     * conditional writer.</li>
     * <li>Because the mutation was accepted, ample never calls the rejectionHandler and returns it
     * as accepted.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h4>Example 3</h4>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>Conditional mutation CM3 with a condition requiring an absent operation that sets the
     * operation id to a fate transaction id is submitted. When it's submitted to ample a
     * rejectionHandler is set that checks if the operation id equals the fate transaction id.</li>
     * <li>The thread running the fate operation dies after submitting the mutation but before
     * seeing it was actually accepted.</li>
     * <li>Later fate creates an identical mutation to CM3, lets call it CM3.2, and resubmits it
     * with the same rejection handler.</li>
     * <li>CM3.2 is rejected because the operation id is not absent.</li>
     * <li>Because the mutation was rejected, ample calls the rejectionHandler. The rejectionHandler
     * sees in the tablet metadata that the operation id is its fate transaction id and reports back
     * true</li>
     * <li>When rejectionHandler reports true, ample reports the mutation as accepted.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param rejectionHandler if the conditional mutation comes back with a status of
     *        {@link org.apache.accumulo.core.client.ConditionalWriter.Status#REJECTED} then read
     *        the tablets metadata and apply this check to see if it should be considered as
