title: Apache Accumulo 1.5.2 Release Notes
---

Apache Accumulo 1.5.2 is a maintenance release on the 1.5 version branch.
This release contains changes from over 100 issues, comprised of bug fixes
(client side and server side), new test cases, and updated Hadoop support
contributed by over 30 different contributors and committers.
As this is a maintenance release, Apache Accumulo 1.5.2 has no client API 
incompatibilities over Apache Accumulo 1.5.0 and 1.5.1 and requires no manual upgrade 
process. Users of 1.5.0 or 1.5.1 are strongly encouraged to update as soon as possible 
to benefit from the improvements.

Users who are new to Accumulo are encouraged to use a 1.6 release as opposed
to the 1.5 line as development has already shifted towards the 1.6 line. For those
who cannot or do not want to upgrade to 1.6, 1.5.2 is still an excellent choice
over earlier versions in the 1.5 line.


## Performance Improvements

Apache Accumulo 1.5.2 includes a number of performance-related fixes over previous versions.


### Write-Ahead Log sync performance

The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) files are used to ensure durability of updates made to Accumulo.
A sync is called on the file in HDFS to make sure that the changes to the WAL are persisted
to disk, which allows Accumulo to recover in the case of failure. [ACCUMULO-2766][9] fixed
an issue where an operation against a WAL would unnecessarily wait for multiple syncs, slowing
down the ingest on the system.

### Minor-Compactions not aggressive enough

On a system with ample memory provided to Accumulo, long hold-times were observed which
blocks the ingest of new updates. Trying to free more server-side memory by running minor
compactions more frequently increased the overall throughput on the node. These changes
were made in [ACCUMULO-2905][10].

### HeapIterator optimization

Iterators, a notable feature of Accumulo, are provided to users as a server-side programming
construct, but are also used internally for numerous server operations. One of these system iterator 
is the HeapIterator which implements a PriorityQueue of other Iterators. One way this iterator is
used is to merge multiple files in HDFS to present a single, sorted stream of Key-Value pairs. [ACCUMULO-2827][11]
introduces a performance optimization to the HeapIterator which can improve the speed of the
HeapIterator in common cases.

### Write-Ahead log sync implementation

In Hadoop-2, two implementations of sync are provided: hflush and hsync. Both of these
methods provide a way to request that the datanodes write the data to the underlying
medium and not just hold it in memory (the *fsync* syscall). While both of these methods
inform the Datanodes to sync the relevant block(s), *hflush* does not wait for acknowledgement
from the Datanodes that the sync finished, where *hsync* does. To provide the most reliable system
"out of the box", Accumulo defaults to *hsync* so that your data is as secure as possible in 
a variety of situations (notably, unexpected power outages).

The downside is that performance tends to suffer because waiting for a sync to disk is a very
expensive operation. [ACCUMULO-2842][12] introduces a new system property, tserver.wal.sync.method,
that lets users to change the HDFS sync implementation from *hsync* to *hflush*. Using *hflush* instead
of *hsync* may result in about a 30% increase in ingest performance.

For users upgrading from Hadoop-1 or Hadoop-0.20 releases, *hflush* is the equivalent of how
sync was implemented in these older versions of Hadoop and should give comparable performance.

### Server-side mutation queue size

When users desire writes to be as durable as possible, using *hsync*, the ingest performance
of the system can be improved by increasing the tserver.mutation.queue.max property. The cost
of this change is that it will cause TabletServers to use additional memory per writer. In 1.5.1,
the value of this parameter defaulted to a conservative 256K, which resulted in sub-par ingest
performance.

1.5.2 and [ACCUMULO-3018][13] increases this buffer to 1M which has a noticeable positive impact on
ingest performance with a minimal increase in TabletServer memory usage.

## Notable Bug Fixes

### Fixes MapReduce package name change

1.5.1 inadvertently included a change to RangeInputSplit which created an incompatibility
with 1.5.0. The original class has been restored to ensure that users accessing
the RangeInputSplit class do not have to alter their client code. See [ACCUMULO-2586][1] for
more information

### Add configurable maximum frame size to Apache Thrift proxy

The Thrift proxy server was subject to memory exhaustion, typically
due to bad input, where the server would attempt to allocate a very large
buffer and die in the process. [ACCUMULO-2658][2] introduces a configuration
parameter, like [ACCUMULO-2360][3], to prevent this error.

### Offline tables can prevent tablet balancing

Before 1.5.2, when a table with many tablets was created, ingested into, and
taken offline, tablet balancing may have stoppped. This would happen if there
were tablet migrations for the table, because the migrations couldn't occur.
The balancer will not run when there are outstanding migrations; therefore, a
system could become unbalanced. [ACCUMULO-2694][4] introduces a fix to ensure
that offline tables do not block balancing and improves the server-side
logging.

### MiniAccumuloCluster process management

MiniAccumuloCluster had a few issues which could cause deadlock or a method that
never returns. Most of these are related to management of the Accumulo processes
([ACCUMULO-2764][5], [ACCUMULO-2985][6], and [ACCUMULO-3055][7]).

### IteratorSettings not correctly serialized in RangeInputSplit

The Writable interface methods on the RangeInputSplit class accidentally omitted
calls to serialize the IteratorSettings configured for the Job. [ACCUMULO-2962][8]
fixes the serialization and adds some additional tests.

### Constraint violation causes hung scans

A failed bulk import transaction had the ability to create an infinitely retrying
loop due to a constraint violation. This directly prevents scans from completing,
but will also hang compactions. [ACCUMULO-3096][14] fixes the issue so that the
constraint no longer hangs the entire system.

## Testing

Each unit and functional test only runs on a single node, while the RandomWalk and Continuous Ingest tests run 
on any number of nodes. *Agitation* refers to randomly restarting Accumulo processes and Hadoop Datanode processes,
and, in HDFS High-Availability instances, forcing NameNode failover.
