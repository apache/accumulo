title: Apache Accumulo 1.8.0 Release Notes
nav: nav_rn_180
---

Apache Accumulo 1.8.0 is a significant release that includes many important
milestone features which expand the functionality of Accumulo. These include
features related to security, availability, and extensibility. Over
350 JIRA issues were resolved in this version. This includes nearly
200 bug fixes and 71 improvements and 4 new features. See
[JIRA][JIRA_180] for the complete list.

In the context of Accumulo's [Semantic Versioning][semver] [guidelines][api],
this is a "minor version". This means that new APIs have been created, some
deprecations may have been added, but no deprecated APIs have been removed.
Code written against 1.7.x should work against 1.8.0 -- binary compatibility
has been preserved with one exception of an already-deprecated Mock Accumulo
utility class. As always, the Accumulo developers take API compatibility
very seriously and have invested much time to ensure that we meet the promises set forth to our users.

## Major Changes

### Speed up WAL roll overs

Performance of writing mutations is improved by refactoring the
bookeeping required for Write-Ahead Log (WAL) files and by creating a
standby WAL for faster switching when the log is full. This was a
substantial refactor in the way WALs worked, but smoothes overall
ingest performance in addition to provides a increase in write speed
as shown by the simple test below. The top entry is before
[ACCUMULO-3423][ACCUMULO-3423] and the bottom graph is after the
refactor.

### User level API for RFile

Previously the only public API available to write RFiles was via the AccumuloFileOutputFormat. There was no way to read RFiles in the public
API. [ACCUMULO-4165][ACCUMULO-4165] exposes a brand new public [API][RFILE_API] for reading and writing RFiles as well as cleans up some of the internal APIs.

### Suspend Tablet assignment for rolling restarts

When a tablet server dies, Accumulo attempted to reassign the tablets as quickly as possible to maintain availability.
A new configuration property `table.suspend.duration` (with a default of zero seconds) now controls how long to wait before reassigning
a tablet from a dead tserver. The property is configurable via the
Accumulo shell, so you can set it, do a rolling restart, and then
set it back to 0. A new state as introduced, TableState.SUSPENDED to support this feature. By default, metadata tablet
reassignment is not suspended, but that can also be changed with the `master.metadata.suspendable` property that is false by
default. Root tablet assignment can not be suspended. See [ACCUMULO-4353] for more info.

### Run multiple Tablet Servers on one node

[ACCUMULO-4328] introduces the capability of running multiple tservers on a single node. This is intended for nodes with a large
amounts of memory and/or disk. This feature is disabled by default. There are several related tickets: [ACCUMULO-4072], [ACCUMULO-4331]
and [ACCUMULO-4406]. Note that when this is enabled, the names of the log files change. Previous log file names were defined in the
generic_logger.xml as `${org.apache.accumulo.core.application}_{org.apache.accumulo.core.ip.localhost.hostname}.log`.
The files will now include the instance id after the application with
`${org.apache.accumulo.core.application}_${instance}_${org.apache.accumulo.core.ip.localhost.hostname}.log`.

For example: tserver_host.domain.com.log will become tserver_1_host.domain.log when multiple TabletServers
are run per host. The same change also applies to the debug logs provided in the example configurations. The log
names do not change if this feature is not used.

### Rate limiting Major Compactions

Major Compactions can significantly increase the amount of load on
TabletServers. [ACCUMULO-4187] restricts the rate at which data is
read and written when performing major compactions. This has a direct
effect on the IO load caused by major compactions with a similar
effect on the CPU utilization. This behavior is controlled by a new
property `tserver.compaction.major.throughput` with a defaults of 0B
which disables the rate limiting.

### Table Sampling

Queryable sample data was added by [ACCUMULO-3913].  This allows users to configure a pluggable
function to generate sample data.  At scan time, the sample data can optionally be scanned.
Iterators also have access to sample data.  Iterators can access all data and sample data, this
allows an iterator to use sample data for query optimizations.  The new user level RFile API
supports writing RFiles with sample data for bulk import.

A simple configurable sampler function is included with Accumulo.  This sampler uses hashing and
can be configured to use a subset of Key fields.  For example if it was desired to have entire rows
in the sample, then this sampler would be configured to hash+mod the row.   Then when a row is
selected for the sample, all of its columns and all of its updates will be in the sample data.
Another scenario is one in which a document id is in the column qualifier.  In this scenario, one
would either want all data related to a document in the sample data or none.  To achieve this, the
sample could be configured to hash+mod on the column qualifier.  See the sample [Readme
example][sample] and javadocs on the new APIs for more information.

For sampling to work, all tablets scanned must have pre-generated sample data that was generated in
the same way.  If this is not the case then scans will fail.  For existing tables, samples can be
generated by configuring sampling on the table and compacting the table.

### Upgrade to Apache Thrift 0.9.3

Accumulo relies on Apache Thrift to implement remote procedure calls between Accumulo services.
Ticket [ACCUMULO-4077][ACCUMULO-4077] updates our dependency to 0.9.3. See the [Apache Thrift 0.9.3 Release Notes][THRIFT-0.9.3-RN] for details
on the changes to Thrift.

### Iterator Test Harness

Users often write iterators without fully understanding its limits and lifetime. Previously, Accumulo did
not provide any means in which a user could test iterators to catch common issues that only become apparent
in multi-node production deployments. [ACCUMULO-626] provides a framework and a collection of initial tests
which can be used to simulate common issues with Iterators that only appear in production deployments. This test
harness can be used directly by users as a supplemental tool to unit tests and integration tests with MiniAccumuloCluster.

Please see the [Accumulo User Manual chapter on Iterator Testing][ITER_TEST] for more information

### Default port for Monitor changed to 9995

Previously, the default port for the monitor was 50095. You will need to update your links to point to port 9995. The default
port for the GC process was also changed from 50091 to 9998, although this an RPC port used internally and automatically discovered.
These default ports were changed because the previous defaults fell in the Linux Ephemeral port range. This means that the operating
system, when a port in this range was unusued, would allocate this port for dynamic network communication. This has the side-effect of
temporal bind issues when trying to start these services (as the operating system might have allocated them elsewhere). By moving These
defaults out of the ephemeral range, we can guarantee that the Monitor and GC will reliably start. These values are still configurable by setting `monitor.port.client`and `gc.port.client` in the accumulo-site.xml


## Other Notable Changes

 * [ACCUMULO-1124] Optimization of RFile index
 * [ACCUMULO-2883] API to fetch current tablet assignments
 * [ACCUMULO-3871] Support for running integration tests in MapReduce
 * [ACCUMULO-3920] Deprecate the MockAccumulo class and remove usage in our tests
 * [ACCUMULO-4339] Make hadoop-minicluster optional dependency of acccumulo-minicluster
 * [ACCUMULO-4318] BatchWriter, ConditionalWriter, and ScannerBase now extend AutoCloseable
 * [ACCUMULO-4326] Value constructor now accepts Strings (and Charsequences)
 * [ACCUMULO-4354] Bump dependency versions to include gson, jetty, and sl4j
 * [ACCUMULO-3735] Bulk Import status page on the monitor
 * [ACCUMULO-4066] Reduced time to processes conditional mutations.
 * [ACCUMULO-4164] Reduced seek time for cached data.

## Testing

Each unit and functional test only runs on a single node, while the RandomWalk
and Continuous Ingest tests run on any number of nodes. *Agitation* refers to
randomly restarting Accumulo processes and Hadoop Datanode processes, and, in
HDFS High-Availability instances, forcing NameNode failover.
