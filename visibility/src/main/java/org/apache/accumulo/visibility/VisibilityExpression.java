/**
 * An opaque type that contains a parsed visibility expression. When this type is constructed with
 * {@link #parse(String)} and then used with
 * {@link VisibilityArbiter#isVisible(VisibilityExpression)} it can be more efficient and avoid
 * reparsing the expression.
 *
 * <p>
 * For reviewers : this type is similar to ColumnVisibility. This interface and impl have goal of
 * being immutable which differs from column visibility. ColumnVisibility leaks internal
 * implementation details in its public API, this type does not.
 *
 * TODO needs better javadoc.
 *
 * Below is an example of using this API.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 * var auth1 = VisibilityExpression.quote("CAT");
 * var auth2 = VisibilityExpression.quote("ðŸ¦•");
 * var auth3 = VisibilityExpression.quote("ðŸ¦–");
 * var visExp = VisibilityExpression
 *     .parse("(" + auth1 + "&" + auth3 + ")|(" + auth1 + "&" + auth2 + "&" + auth1 + ")");
 * System.out.println(visExp.getExpression());
 * System.out.println(visExp.normalize());
 * System.out.println(visExp.getAuthorizations());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The above example will print the following.
 *
 * <pre>
 * (CAT&amp;"ðŸ¦–")|(CAT&amp;"ðŸ¦•"&CAT)
 * ("ðŸ¦•"&amp;CAT)|("ðŸ¦–"&amp;CAT)
 * [ðŸ¦–, CAT, ðŸ¦•]
 * </pre>
 *
 * @since ???
