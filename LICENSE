   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    The Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License

    THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
    COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
    COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
    AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
    
    BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
    TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
    BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
    CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
    CONDITIONS.
    
    1. Definitions
    
    "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
    encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,
    along with one or more other contributions, constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.
    A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
    Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    
    "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
    http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
    Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
    including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that
    have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of
    this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of
    derivatives of works made available under that license under this
    License or either a Creative Commons unported license or a Creative
    Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
    License.
    
    "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
    dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound
    recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form
    in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a
    work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
    Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of
    doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
    ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
    this License.
    
    "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
    selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
    Attribution, ShareAlike.
    
    "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offers the Work under the terms of this License.
    
    "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
    who created the Work.
    
    "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
    terms of this License.
    
    "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
    who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect
    to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
    exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
    
    2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
    limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
    limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
    copyright law or other applicable laws.
    
    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
    
    to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collective Works;
    
    to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
    Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
    reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that
    changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could
    be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
    a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
    
    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
    the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    
    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
    Derivative Works.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
    
    Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
    exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event that
    Licensor is a member of a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI,
    SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public performance or public
    digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
    
    Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive
    right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
    designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord
    You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to
    the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright
    Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    
    Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
    where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right
    to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society
    (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
    webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
    USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
    jurisdictions).
    
    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
    known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
    such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
    in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
    are hereby reserved.
    
    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    
    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
    must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
    License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
    may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of
    this License or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise of
    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You
    may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer
    to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You
    distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
    perform the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the
    Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to
    exercise of the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
    License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
    Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
    from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
    You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
    the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as
    required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c),
    as requested.
    
    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of this
    License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
    Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons (Unported)
    license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a
    later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
    License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (Unported)); (iv) a Creative
    Commons Compatible License. If you license the Derivative Work under one
    of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of
    that license. If you license the Derivative Work under the terms of any
    of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
    License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
    generally and with the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy
    of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, the Applicable License with
    every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute,
    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform; (II)
    You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
    restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of a
    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact
    all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer
    of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute, publicly display, publicly
    perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any
    technological measures on the Derivative Work that restrict the ability
    of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights
    granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
    This Section 4(b) applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a
    Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
    from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of the
    Applicable License.
    
    If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
    Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as
    defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been made
    pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
    and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
    supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
    another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
    journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
    notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such
    party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
    reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
    Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
    not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and, consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a
    credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
    "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
    Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
    however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a
    minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part
    of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
    for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may
    only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
    attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights
    under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
    any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use
    of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of
    the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    
    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
    
    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
    OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE
    LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
    OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
    MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
    NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
    THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
    JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
    EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
    ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
    ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    7. Termination
    
    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective
    Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
    
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
    stated above.
    
    8. Miscellaneous
    
    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
    defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in Section
    1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on
    the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.
    
    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
    Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
    the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.
    
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
    enforceable.
    
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
    appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
    without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

    3. Distribution Obligations.
    
    3.1. Availability of Source Code.
    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
    Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that
    Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this
    License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
    Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise
    make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software
    in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in
    Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
    customarily used for software exchange.
    3.2. Modifications.
    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe
    Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
    sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
    3.3. Required Notices.
    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies
    You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter
    any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
    Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
    attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
    Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
    License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer,
    and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
    obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you
    may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
    Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
    such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability terms You offer.
    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
    terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,
    which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
    are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license
    for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the
    recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in
    this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form
    under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any
    terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
    the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
    the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
    You offer.
    3.6. Larger Works.
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other
    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
    Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
    requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

    4. Versions of the License.
    
    4.1. New Versions.
    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
    versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a
    distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one
    other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
    4.2. Effect of New Versions.
    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
    which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
    Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from
    being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
    version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
    which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may
    also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
    available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
    published by the license steward.
    4.3. Modified Versions.
    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
    for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of
    this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to
    the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs
    from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license
    contains terms which differ from this License.

    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
    
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
    DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
    SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
    RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
    THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
    DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO
    USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
    DISCLAIMER.
    
    6. TERMINATION.
    
    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
    such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
    which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
    this License shall survive.
    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
    judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
    Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
    referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software
    (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
    or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
    granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
    Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
    Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon
    60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
    automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if
    within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
    Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or
    pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes
    any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
    settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
    then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
    under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
    amount or value of any payment or license.
    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all
    end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted
    to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
    
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
    SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
    PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
    OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
    GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL
    OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
    OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
    
    The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in
    48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer
    software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1))
    and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used
    in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
    48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
    End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth
    herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and
    supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that
    addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.
    
    9. MISCELLANEOUS.
    
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
    such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
    jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original
    Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
    otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions.
    Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
    jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue
    specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the
    losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
    costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
    the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
    Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
    the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
    not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for
    compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and
    the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You
    use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    
    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
    
    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out
    of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work
    with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
    
    NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION
    LICENSE (CDDL)
    
    The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the
    State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any
    litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction
    of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the
    state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
    County, California.
