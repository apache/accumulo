/**
 * An interface used with the Java {@link ServiceLoader} to auto-discover classes executable with a
 * convenient keyword on the command-line.
 *
 * <p>
 * All implementing classes who have an entry in
 * META-INF/services/{@link org.apache.accumulo.start.spi.KeywordExecutable} on the classpath will
 * be constructed by the {@link ServiceLoader}, so they should be lightweight and quickly
 * constructible with a mandatory no-argument constructor. Because of this, implementing classes
 * could simply be factories which execute a different class, if that class is expensive to
 * construct or cannot have a no-argument constructor.
 *
 * <p>
 * One way to easily create META-INF/services files is to use the
 * <a href="https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/service">AutoService</a> annotation.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the implementing class also wishes to have a redundant main method, it may be useful to simply
 * implement main as:<br>
 * {@code new MyImplementingClass().execute(args);}
